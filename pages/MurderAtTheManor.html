			"Murder at the Manor" was our winning submission to the D&AD New Blood Awards 2020. It was specifically for the RARE and Xbox brief that asked designers to create a concept of a game that "helps players create stories together". 
			Although only a concept was required, the team were able to create a working prototype that showcased core mechanics and USP's of the game. 
			My tasks primarily consisted of the level design, the functionality of the game, and what mechanics and motives each player will have. I also acted as the spokesperson for the team and presented the game with our Video presentation. 
			The team is very proud to win the Graphite Pencil award, but we are also proud of the project in its entirety. The University acknowledged our win with their newsletter where we all gave an interview detailing how and why we chose to enter:
